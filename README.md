## About the Game

**Shadows of Valor** is a single-player 2D Metroidvania with gothic pixel art inspired by **Dead Cells**, **Blasphemous** and **Castlevania: SotN**. The player assumes the role of a knight fighting in the dark world against skeletons, traps and inner pain.

The game combines dynamic battles, thoughtful level design and atmospheric surroundings. All levels are manually designed, but supplemented with procedural generation of objects, enemies and traps.
